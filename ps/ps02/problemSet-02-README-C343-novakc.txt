B.
1. To increase the efficiency and decrease the average time of searching for an element in a BST.
2a. See image in folder
2b. 
Preorder: 15 5 7 20 18 16 25
Inorder: 5 7 15 16 18 20 25
Postorder: 7 5 16 18 25 20 15
3a. Unsorted Array because the records are already sorted, therefor we donâ€™t need a sorted data structure.
3b. Unsorted Array because there are a high number of insertions, and since the size of the data is already given an array is preferred. 
3c. BST because the number of insertions is the same as the searches.
3d. BST because the number of searches is so high, therefore we need the best search time and BST is better with inserting over a sorted array.

C.
1. The lowest level of a tree.
